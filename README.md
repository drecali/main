1. Fork the FCC Ulsan main repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top left of the page.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Configure the `origin` and `upstream` correctly.

   - `origin`'s URL should point to your fork, so the URL should have your GitHub account in it.
   - `upstream`'s URL should point to the original repository, so the URL should be `https://github.com/fcculsan/main.git`.
   - use `git remote` to see if `origin` and `upstream` exist.

     - use `git remote get-url origin` and `git remote get-url upstream` to see what the URLs are.

   - If `origin` or `upstream` have the wrong URLs, you can rename them with `git remote rename (oldname) (newname)` or delete them with `git remote remove (origin/upstream)` and create them with the correct URL using `git remote add (origin/upstream) (URL)`.

4. Push your local commit to your remote fork.
   - `git push origin master`
5. Go to your forked repository on the GitHub website.
6. Click the "Pull Request" button to the right of where you see "This branch is 1 commit ahead of fcculsan:master."
7. Click the green "Create Pull Request" button.
8. Describe your changes, and submit it.
9. You're done!
