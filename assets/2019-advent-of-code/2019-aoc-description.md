Advent of Code and Twitter Doesn't Suck

# Description

\*\*\*\* Location info below\*\*\*\*

It's the most wonderful time of the year! Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. A new puzzle is released every day.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

Also, we'll talk about the countless benefits of Twitter for developers. Turns out there are a lot of developers on Twitter sharing tools, projects, best practices, and answering questions. That's right, there's more than banal breakfasts, memes, inane celebutantes, vapid expressions, and tribalism on Twitter. A well-curated feed can be worth its weight in gold! Find out how to get there.

Message from the organizer:
I learned to code in my spare time in just a few months using freeCodeCamp's online curriculum, then I worked as a web developer abroad. The experience changed my life and now I want everyone to know how easy it is to get started coding. Before I started learning, I had no idea that you could get job-ready using only free online resources. Coding was never on my radar until a friend told me about freeCodeCamp and dragged me to a meeting. Being around other people on the same learning journey helped a lot.
